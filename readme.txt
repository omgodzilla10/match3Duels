Match 3 Duel – GDD

Gameplay

Gameplay will consist of two players, or one player and an AI, casting spells at each other until one player is defeated (health reaches zero). The players will cast spells via a match-3 mini-game. Each “gem” on the board will cast a different spell when it is matched with two other gems of the same type. Matching more than three gems of the same type will cause a critical hit. In the meta-game, players can build decks of gems, and select which gems they have access to in-game.
The game will have a modern, simplistic art style, following Google's Material design. The user experience must feel smooth, modern, and futuristic. Minimalism will be at the heart of the visual design.

In the first two minutes of the game launching, the user will reach a main menu screen. The main menu screen will have an option for playing with an ai, customizing their deck, and further in development, the menu will have an option for playing online.

Spells

The game will start the user off with 5 default gems, and more gems will be given to the user over the course of the game. The default spells may include:

 - Fireball - deals a burst of damage
 - Lightening - deals a burst of damage
 - Poison - Deals small amounts of damage over time
 - Heal - heals the player for a certain amount of HP
 - Shield - Any attacks in the next 3 seconds will do 50% less  		 damage.

All of the gems the user can obtain will be in the following categories:

 - Damage Burst (fireball, lightening bolt)
 - Damage overtime (poison)
 - Heal/Support (heal, shield)

The user will receive XP for every match they play. The amount of XP they receive is doubled if they win the match. Everytime the player levels up, they will receive a choice of three unknown gems, which are each labelled with their spell type but not their actual attributes. When the player selects one of the three gems, the other two are removed, and the selected gem and it's spell attributes are revealed. As the user gains more and more levels, the XP required to reach the next level will be increased.

Target Platform / Hardware

We'll be specifically targetting Android devices. The minimum specs have not been determined, but will likely be low, because the game is only 2d and contains minimal visual effects.

Visual Style

**todo**

Audio Style

The in-game audio will only consist of sound effects occuring when spells are cast, or when gems are moved around. Separate sounds may occur when a critical spell is cast, or when either player dies. There will be no need for voice work or music composition, at least for the time being.

Starting Out

Game Start - Main Menu

The Main Menu will have three selectable options:
- Play
- Customize Deck
- Options

The "Play" option, when selected, will take the user to a screen where they can select their gem deck to use for the game, as well as the AI difficulty. When the player starts the match, the primary match interface will load, and a 3-second countdown will lead the player into the match.

The primary match interface will show a 8x8 match-3 interface at the bottom, the player's health bar in green below it. Above the match-3 board will be the actual playing field, which will have a glass-like appearance. The playing field will be where spells that are cast by either player are shot across, and where the visual effects will appear. At the top of the screen will be the opponent's health bar, which will look identical to the player's health bar.

Game End Screen

At the end of the game, the victor will be declared on screen. A 5-second timer will appear, asking the user to tap if they want a rematch. In online mode, the game will start again if both players tap for a rematch. If the rematch does not receive two votes, the game will end, and players will resume to the main menu.

If the user has won any new gems or items, they will be displayed on screen immeadiatley when the user returns to the main menu.

Customize Deck Screen

The deck customization menu will have 5 slots for 5 different gems. Every gem that the player owns will appear in an inventory interface in the lower half of the screen, and the 5 equip slots will appear above the inventory. Users can drag each gem to a slot to fill the slot of replace whatever was in that slot. The player can also tap on each gem to see more information about it.

 - Sound (toggle)
 - Sound Volume (slider)
 - ??? (more to come)
