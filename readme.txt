Match 3 Duel – GDD

Gameplay
Gameplay will consist of two players, or one player and an AI, casting spells at each other until one player is defeated (health reaches zero). The players will cast spells via a match-3 mini-game. Each “gem” on the board will cast a different spell when it is matched with two other gems of the same type. Matching more than three gems of the same type will cause a critical hit. In the meta-game, players can build decks of gems, and select which gems they have access to in-game.
